    <h1>8 STEPS TO FILE A PETITION</h1>
    <h2>
      Each initiative and referendum state employs a different procedure for
      filing petition applications. Some states require preliminary signatures
      while others do not. In addition, several states review each proposed
      statute, verifying that the law conforms to the style and conventions of
      state law and recommending alterations to initiative proponents.<a

      committee, other than the petitioner, is funding a portion of the drafting
      or submission of the sample sheet, the petitioner must also attach to the
