    <h1>Your Steps To File A Petition!</h1>
        Each initiative and referendum state employs a different procedure for filing petition applications. Some states require preliminary signatures while others do not. In addition, several states review each proposed statute, verifying that the law conforms to the style and conventions of state law and recommending alterations to initiative proponents.<br><a href="https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Elections/Petitions/MakeYourVoiceHeard2022Cycle.pdf" target="_blank"> See The Official Handbook.</a>
