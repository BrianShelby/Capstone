# YouVote - Capstone Overview

## Overview

The YouVote Capstone project is being created to help American voters learn more about their local political leaders, learn how to create and submit petitions, and learn out how to register to vote. The YouVote single page web application will have a landing page that welcomes the user with up-coming election information, statistics and historical timelines of major laws that have been inacted over past decades and current pertinent laws as well.

The YouVote Web Application will consist of three main navigation links and a main search bar to help voters search for legislative leaders in their area. The three links will be named below.

1. `Start a petition`
2. [Stylelint](stylelint.io)
3. [Prettier](prettier.io)

## Get Started

**First and foremost,** make sure that your local machine is set up with all of the 'dev environment tooling' as per the instructions in the curriculum.

Well, after establishing your directory structure on your local machine, (e.g. '~/Code/SavvyCoders'), clone the Savvy Starter Repo - essentially, there should be a button that says **Use this template.**

> [Read more about using templates on GitHub here...](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

Once this repo has been created on your GitHub, you can click on the button to 'clone' it as usual.

Once it's `clone`d to your local machine, `cd` into the directory and **be sure to do:** `npm i` to get all of the dependencies installed. If you see any _errors_ (warnings are OK) on Windows, you may have to do `npm install`.

Now, enter `code .` to open this project in VS Code, and look for a prompt to 'install some extensions' once inside VS Code (in the bottom `right` of your screen). You should install these.

In your repo, feel free to update this README and make any other initial changes to files, etc. Then go ahead and do your usual `git` steps -- add, commit, and push.

**Note:** This is a template repository, no need to 'fork it.
